# VIME: Variational Information Maximizing Exploration

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of [VIME: Variational Information Maximizing Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09674). It is based off the following [repository](https://github.com/openai/vime).

It uses [standard policy gradient methods](https://medium.com/@ts1829/policy-gradient-reinforcement-learning-in-pytorch-df1383ea0baf)

- [REINFORCE](https://github.com/JamesChuanggg/pytorch-REINFORCE)
